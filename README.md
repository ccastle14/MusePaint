# MusePaint
Python program to convert music to a computer-drawn image.

MUSI 4450 Final Project
Author: Colin Cassell
Created: 4/28/22

This project, MusePaint, will paint a picture on screen based on the audio input, whether
that's speaking, music, or other sound effects. It uses the tkinter library to draw, PyAudio to
take audio input, and Pillow (python imaging library) to save the images you create.

While the program is running and the canvas is selected, you can use "control-s" to save the image,
and you can use "control-c" to clear the current image.
